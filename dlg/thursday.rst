Freedom of choice
-----------------

[MANDELBROT]_

    What kind of sicko wants to play Nim every day, when they know they're going to lose?

[TRIPITAKA]_

    I guess I prefer my freedom of choice.

[MANDELBROT]_

    We both have freedom of choice.

[TRIPITAKA]_

    No, I can choose whichever coins I like.

    You on the other hand, are compelled to follow the pattern.

    At the moment I suggest a game, you imagine yourself the winner.

    And consequently, every move you make is decided by me.

About winning
-------------

[MANDELBROT]_

    Well you're forgetting one thing. I own twelve silver coins.
    Precisely because I *am* always the winner.

[TRIPITAKA]_

    And yet you never spend them on anything. You've had them for years.

    It seems all you can do with them is play Nim.

[MANDELBROT]_

    See, this is why I hate you, Tripitaka.

    I should have hooked up with Roger Bacon instead.

[TRIPITAKA]_

    He doesn't have my sense of humour though.

[MANDELBROT]_

    *Fractals*.

[TRIPITAKA]_

    I heard that.
