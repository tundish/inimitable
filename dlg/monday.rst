[TRIPITAKA]_

    Mandelbrot.

[MANDELBROT]_

    Yes?

[TRIPITAKA]_

    It is chilly, and there are leaves on the ground.

[MANDELBROT]_

    Yes, it is Autumn.

[TRIPITAKA]_

    Should we play again, do you think?

[MANDELBROT]_

    Must we?

[TRIPITAKA]_

    Well, it is Autumn.

[NARRATOR]_

    **Mandelbrot** sighs. He takes from his purse a handful of coins, and drops them at their feet.

    Well go on then. You first.

[TRIPITAKA]_

[MANDELBROT]_

    You may choose `one <02.html>`__, `two <03.html>`__ or `three <04.html>`__ coins.

    But choose wisely!

    I'm afraid I might be a little rusty.
