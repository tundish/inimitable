[TRIPITAKA]_

    How many coins do you have again?

[MANDELBROT]_

    Twelve.

    You know, that's strange. After all we've been through, and I still haven't
    spent any money.

[TRIPITAKA]_

    Well that's good, because I still haven't figured this out.

    Now then, shall I take `one <01.html>`__, `two <02.html>`__ or `three <03.html>`__ coins?

[MANDELBROT]_

    Look, if you can't make a proper analysis of the situation, why don't you
    pick at random_?

    Just let me know.
    `One <05.html>`__, `two <06.html>`__ or `three <07.html>`__?

    Exactly.
