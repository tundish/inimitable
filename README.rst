Three Games with Tripitaka
==========================

This is a simple, choice-based hypertext game.

Version 0.2.0 was uploaded for the 2020 `Philosophy Game Jam <https://itch.io/jam/philosophy-game-jam-3>`__,
where it placed third overall.

It uses Punchline_, a Python static blog generator. It remains under development as a teaching example.

The site is created with this command::

    punchline --config punchline.cfg --output docs dlg/

Or you can play it online courtesy of `GitHub Pages <https://tundish.github.io/inimitable/>`__.
